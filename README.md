# Jotun

Jotun is a small 3D viewer for Collada file. It was built to strengthen my knowledge of OpenGl. It has been tested with Collada file generated from Maya, so it is possible that some Collada file doesn&#39;t work.

## Setup

Jotun use the following library:

- glfw3\_x64
- glm\_x64

As they have been downloaded with &quot;vcpkg&quot;, there is no explicit link to those libraries. To compile the project, you must download these 2 libraries with &quot;vcpkg&quot;, or if you want to use another method, you will have to specify it in the project property.
